# project-0-S23
# Project 0 Spring 2023
# Unix Utilities
*Before beginning:* Read this  [lab tutorial](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-tutorial.pdf) ; it has some useful tips for programming in the C environment. 
In this part of the project, you’ll build a couple of different UNIX utilities, simple versions of commonly used commands *ls*, *cp*. We’ll call each of them a slightly different name to avoid confusion; for example, instead of *ls*, you’ll be implementing *tuls* .

*Objectives:*
* Re-familiarize yourself with the C programming language 
* Re-familiarize yourself with a shell / terminal / command-line of UNIX 
* Learn (as a side effect) how to use a proper code editor such as emacs, or vi, or… 
* Learn a little about how UNIX utilities are implemented 

While the project focuses on writing simple C programs, you can see from the above that even doing so requires a bunch of other previous knowledge, including a basic idea of what a shell is and how to use the command line on some UNIX-based systems (e.g., Linux or macOS), how to use an editor such as emacs, and of course a basic understanding of C programming. If you *do not* have these skills already, this is not the right place to start (that is, do a refresh of C programming before starting the project). 

Summary of what gets turned in: 
*  A bunch of single .c files for each of the utilities below: *tuls.c*, *tucp.c*,*.* 
*  Each should compile successfully when compiled with the *-Wall* and *-Werror* flags. 
*  Each should (hopefully) meet the requirements we will discuss. 

# Tips
*Start small, and get things working incrementally.* 
 
*Testing is critical.* A great programmer we once knew said you have to write five to ten lines of test code for every line of code you produce; testing your code to make sure it works is crucial. Write tests to see if your code handles all the cases you think it should. Be as comprehensive as you can be. Of course, when grading your projects, we will be. Thus, it is better if you find your bugs first, before we do. 

*Keep old versions around.* Keep copies of older versions of your program around, as you may introduce bugs and not be able to easily undo them. A simple way to do this is to keep copies around, by explicitly making copies of the file at various points during development. For example, let’s say you get a simple version of tuls.c working (say, that just reads in the file); type cp tuls.c tuls.v1.c
to make a copy into the file tuls.v1.c. (In Part B, you will use a different method for version control.) 

# Part A
# tuls
The program *tuls* is a simple program. Generally, it lists information about the FILES in a directory. By default, *tuls* lists the files in the current directory. 
To invoke the program the user types:  
prompt> *./tuls*
 >    lscmd.c  
 >    a.out                        << Output from the tuls command
 >    ..  
 >    .  
  
or, 

prompt> *./tuls  direc    <*where *direc* is a directory path*>*  
>[[direc]]  
>      ->direc_1_file  
>      ->direc_2_file  
>local_1_file  
>local_2_file  
>local_3_file  
>..  
>.  
 
As shown, *tuls* prints out the contents of the specified directory. When there is no additional parameter for the *tuls* command, just the list of the files in the current directory is produced. When a directory path is included with the *tuls* command, then the *tuls* command prints the list of files in the current directory and *recursively* prints the list of files in all directories specified by the directory path argument. Recursively in this case means that if the content of a directory includes a directory, print the content of that directory.

The “*./*” before the *tuls* above is a UNIX thing; it just tells the system which directory to find *tuls* (in this case, in the “.” (dot) directory, which means the /current working directory/). 

To create the *tuls* executable, you’ll be creating a single source file, *tuls.c*, and writing a little C code to implement this simplified version of *tuls*. To compile this program, you will do the following: 

prompt> gcc -o tuls tuls.c -Wall -Werror 
prompt>  

This will make a single **executable binary** called *tuls* which you can then run as above. 

You’ll need to learn how to use a few library routines from the C standard library (often called *libc*) to implement the source code for this program, which we’ll assume is in a file called *tuls.c*. All C code is automatically linked with the C library, which is full of useful functions you can call to implement your program. Learn more about the C library  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library)  and perhaps  [here](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~sshaikot/docs/Other/C%20Library%20Reference%20Guide.pdf) . 

For this project, we recommend using the following routines to do operations on directories: *scandir()*, *opendir()*, *readdir(),* and *closedir()*. Whenever you use a new function like this, the first thing you should do is *read about it* — how else will you learn to use it properly? 

On UNIX/Linux systems, the best way to read about such functions is to use what are called the *man* pages (short for *manual*). In our HTML/web-driven world, the man pages feel a bit antiquated, but they are useful and informative and generally quite easy to use. 

To access the man page for *scandir()*, for example, just type the following at your UNIX shell prompt: 

	prompt> man scandir

Then, *read!* Reading man pages effectively takes practice; why not start learning now? 

We will also give a simple overview here. The *scandir()* function scans a directory for matching entries and returns the number of directory entries found. 

Here is a typical usage of *scandir()*: 
        
```
struct dirent **namelist;
int n; 
n=scandir(“.”,&namelist,NULL,alphasort);
printf(“Number Files %d\n”, n);
        if (n == -1) {
            perror(“scandir”);
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
        while (n—)
        {
            printf(“%s\n”,namelist[n]->d_name);
            free(name[n]);
        }
```


A couple of points here. First, note that *scandir()* takes multiple arguments: the /directory to search, an array to store the found entries, a ‘filter’ for the files to return, and a parameter specifying how to sort the found entries/. Read the man pages to see how to use the arguments. 

Second, note the /critical/ checking of whether the *scandir()* actually succeeded. This is not Java where an exception will be thrown when things goes wrong; rather, it is C, and it is expected (in good programs, i.e., the only kind you’d want to write) that you always will check if the function call succeeded. Reading the man page tells you the details of what is returned when an error is encountered; in this case, the Linux man page says: 

	The *scandir*() function returns the number of directory entries selected. On error, -1 is returned, with  [errno]
  (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html)  set to indicate the error. 
  
Thus, as the code above does, please check that *scandir()* does not return -1 before trying to use the return value. 

Third, note that when the error case occurs, the program prints a message and then exits with error status of 1. In UNIX systems, it is traditional to return 0 upon success, and non-zero upon failure. Here, we will use 1 to indicate failure. 

Side note: if *scandir()* does fail, there are many reasons possible as to why. You can use the functions *perror()* or *strerror()* to print out more about /why/ the error occurred; learn about those on your own (using … you guessed it … the man pages!). 

To print out directory contents, just use *printf()*. For example, after reading the directory entry names with *scandir()* into an array named *namelist*, you can just print out individual entry names as follows: 

printf(“%s\n”, namelist[i]->d_name); 

The ‘->’symbol is used to specify a component of the structure of the namelist entry, in this case one that has the entry name. Look in the system include file **<dirent.h>** to explore the contents of the **dirent** structure.   

Note that inclusion of a newline (\n) character to the printf(), because the **d-name** entry is just a text string with the entry name. 

**Details**
* Your program *tuls* can be invoked with zero or one argument on the command line; with 1 argument, recursively print the entries in the directories in the local directory as well as the files in the local directory.
* In all non-error cases, *tuls* should exit with status code 0, usually by returning a 0 from *main()* (or by calling *exit(0)*).
* If /arguments/ are specified on the command line, *tuls* should just print the names of the entries (files and directories) in the current directory. 
* If the program tries and fails to *open or scan a directory*, it should print the exact message “tuls: cannot open directory” (followed by a newline) and exit with status code 1. 
# Part B
# tucp
The second utility you will build is called **tucp**, a variant of the UNIX tool *cp*. In this project, this command is used to copy files or a group of files. It creates an exact image (copy) of a file on a disk. The *tucp* command requires at least two filenames in its arguments.  
The following are the possible command usages: 

*tucp* Sourcefile Destinationfile 
*tucp* Sourcefile Directory 
*tucp* Sourcefile-1 Sourcefile-2 Sourcefile-3 Sourcefile-n Directory 

# Details
* If the *tucp* command contains two file names, then it copies the contents of the 1st file to the 2nd file. If the 2nd file doesn’t exist, then it first creates a file with the specified name and the content of the first file is copied to it. But if the second file already exists, then it is simply overwritten without any warning. 
* If the *tucp* command has one or more arguments, specifying source file names and following those arguments, an argument specifying a directory name, then the command copies each source file to the destination directory with the same source file name. The destination file is created if did not exist, or overwritten if it already existed.
* The Linux function **stat()** can be used to determine information about a file. The **stat struct** returned by the function includes a field, **st_mode** , that can be used to determine if the path evaluated by **stat()** is a file or a directory. Use **man** to learn about the functions **stat()** and **inode()**. 
### Additional Tips
**Testing is critical.** As noted above, include sufficient code to test your code to make sure it works is crucial. [This is a good time to learn to *use a debugger*]. Write tests to see if your code handles all the cases you think it should. Be as comprehensive as you can be. Of course, when grading your projects, we will be. Thus, it is better if you find your bugs first, before we do.
*Keep old versions around.*  Sophisticated developers use version control systems git (e.g.,through GitHub); We will be using GitHub beginning with this part of the project. A repository will be created for your use. That is, **we will create a private repository for your use for each project** assignment going forward. **You are not to use your own personal GitHub account.**
### Footnotes 
1: Unfortunately, there is a lot to learn about the C library, but at some point, you’ve just got to **read documentation** to learn what is available. Why not now, when you are young? Or, if you are old, why not now, before it’s … ahem … too late? We will use C library functions and system calls (including from other libraries) in all of our projects.
